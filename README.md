Parameter: Heart Rate bpm
Normal range: 60 to 100
Alert range: 101 to 120
Critical range: Above 120 or below 55
Medical explanation: Heart rate shows how fast the heart is beating. When it becomes too fast or too slow, the heart may not pump blood effectively, causing dizziness, weakness, or risk of cardiac distress.

Parameter: Body Temperature Fahrenheit
Normal range: 97 to 99
Alert range: 99.1 to 100.5
Critical range: Above 100.5
Medical explanation: Body temperature reflects how the body is fighting infections. Very high fever means the body is struggling, which can lead to dehydration or serious infection.

Parameter: Oxygen Level SpO2 percent
Normal range: 95 to 100
Alert range: 90 to 94
Critical range: Below 90
Medical explanation: Oxygen level shows how much oxygen is carried in the blood. Low oxygen affects the brain and organs and can be dangerous if it falls too low.

Parameter: Blood Pressure Systolic mmHg
Normal range: 90 to 120
Alert range: 121 to 140
Critical range: Above 140
Medical explanation: Systolic pressure shows how much pressure the heart generates while pumping. High values mean the heart is working too hard, which may cause stroke or heart damage.

Parameter: Blood Pressure Diastolic mmHg
Normal range: 60 to 80
Alert range: 81 to 90
Critical range: Above 90
Medical explanation: Diastolic pressure shows how much pressure remains when the heart relaxes between beats. High values mean the blood vessels are under stress even at rest.

Parameter: Glucose Level mg dL
Normal range: 70 to 140
Alert range: 141 to 200
Critical range: Above 200
Medical explanation: Glucose level tells how much sugar is in the blood. Very high levels mean the body cannot use sugar properly, which can damage organs and lead to diabetic emergencies.
